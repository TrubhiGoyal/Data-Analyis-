📊 Payroll Data Analysis Using SQL
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a real-world payroll dataset using MySQL.
The objective was to clean raw payroll data, transform financial fields into structured numeric formats, and generate meaningful business insights related to salary distribution, overtime trends, departmental spending, and employee cost structure.

The project simulates a real-world freelance data analysis assignment in which raw business data is converted into actionable insights.
